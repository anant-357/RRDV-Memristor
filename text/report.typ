  *Abstract* \
  Resistive memory systems are a promising solution for low-power machine learning. Their ability to perform calculations directly within memroy eliminates energy-intensive data movemennt. Memristors, a type of resistive memory, are particularly attractive due to their small size. We've developed a new training algorithm that uses simple components to achieve accurate neural network weights without complex calculations. This methos allows for faster training and higher speed compared to traditional approaches.
